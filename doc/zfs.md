# ZFS
ZFS property arrays are not a native iplementation, but are implemented within Tredly, and are in the form "com.tredly.<arrayname>:<item number>". For example:
* com.tredly.tcpinports:0
* com.tredly.tcpinports:1
* com.tredly.tcpinports:2
* etc

Using this methodology, it is possible to also support associative arrays, however this has not yet been implemented.
